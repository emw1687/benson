both had careers in the travel industry and were able to travel, study, live and work in many places around the world. in 1980, we chose seattle as our favorite place to live, especially on queen anne. \r\n\r\nnow that we are both retired from the full time working world we have found many interesting and pleasurable activities, in addition to hosting of course that fill our time. \r\n\r\nthese include cooking (inspired by barbara's time as a personal chef), in-city and in-nature walking, spending quality time with our family and friends, being active grandparents, appreciating seattle's world class arts scene (especially opera, ballet, theater & gallery arts) just to name a few. \r\n\r\nwe are both very interested in the study of herbs and essential oils (aroma therapy). in addition, barbara continues on as a licensed yoga therapist and teaches yoga.\r\n\r\nmichael is involved in the growing \"movement for health\" scene. he is also developing a series of books for children (and the child in all of us) around the theme of giraffes.\r\n\r\nlast but not least is sammy, our 5 year old beagle. he is friendly and adorable. he helps both of us to be in the moment and connected to the outdoors as we walk through the different neighborhoods on queen anne. and he\r\ndoesn't bark or
