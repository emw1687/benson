we are eager to get to know europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional american tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  we have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.

john is a great cook and alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the states. we have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.

as a host: think singapore airlines first-class, not a delta red-eye the night before thanksgiving. i believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. when you stay at my home, i want you to feel like it's your home. kick back and relax. if you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. i speak french, mandarin, cantonese, spanish and am learning arabic right now. i grew up in a french province and used to bartend so i can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. i'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; i can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and love love love to help people find a satisfying meal. random jobs i've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. right now, i'm a software architect. my husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. he speaks arabic, french and german. she speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

as a guest: i've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. i like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). i'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since i've last tried). ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. i also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. i've never joined a curated tour group and i hope i never do. i've pet tigers in chiang mai, bathed with yakuza in tokyo, eaten scorpions in beijing, shot snake vodka in taipei, swam with jellyfish in valencia, was marooned in both paris and madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of stuttgart... the list just goes on. my next trip is to the french/italian riviera for some serious r&r.

my dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. specifically a program that will send doctors from the us to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick. i believe that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status. 

while in college i owned a company that produced raves and concerts near san francisco. while i don't produce raves anymore, i still run (website hidden) on the side, which sells music. 

i joke around a lot and act like a kid when i'm around cute little pets. i love plants and growing plants. if i get an avocado (yum!) i plant the seed. 

one indicator of successful people is their ability to choose a greater reward that takes longer to achieve, versus an inferior reward that takes less time. i typically wait the longer period for the greater reward.

i run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my lonely buildings project.  mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  i love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  i (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   i play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. maybe i'll take you out on the water if interested! 

check out my venues by searching ""fremont abbey"" or ""ballard homestead"" for concert listings.

my housemates and i love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy b&b or hotel. 
  
though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

i love to travel and have been so far to iceland, copenhagen, berlin, haiti, new zealand, australia, honduras, mexico, scotland, ireland, england, canada, nyc, austin, california, etc. 

i love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too.

seattle, washington, usa                   member since october 2013.

thanks for checking us out for your visit to seattle. we would like to be your local hosts while you are here.

barbara is a native of austria and speaks german as well as english.  michael is from miami and speaks spanish, portuguese and some italian.  we both had careers in the travel industry and were able to travel, study, live and work in many places around the world. in 1980, we chose seattle as our favorite place to live, especially on queen anne. 

now that we are both retired from the full time working world we have found many interesting and pleasurable activities, in addition to hosting of course that fill our time. 

these include cooking (inspired by barbara's time as a personal chef), in-city and in-nature walking, spending quality time with our family and friends, being active grandparents, appreciating seattle's world class arts scene (especially opera, ballet, theater & gallery arts) just to name a few. 

we are both very interested in the study of herbs and essential oils (aroma therapy). in addition, barbara continues on as a licensed yoga therapist and teaches yoga.

michael is involved in the growing ""movement for health"" scene. he is also developing a series of books for children (and the child in all of us) around the theme of giraffes.

last but not least is sammy, our 5 year old beagle. he is friendly and adorable. he helps both of us to be in the moment and connected to the outdoors as we walk through the different neighborhoods on queen anne. and he
doesn't bark or bay!!!

when traveling, i try to be economical while also making sure i have a full, rich experience. i think there are plenty of great places to stay, restaurants to try, and experiences to have that are special and don't have to cost a fortune. 

as a host, i want to help my guests have the best experience possible. if that consists of giving them suggestions or even helping them with transportation, i am happy to oblige. if they just want me to show them the space, give them the key, and nothing more, that is fine too. seattle is a great place, and everyone should be able to experience it in the way that suits them best.

adam is a computer whiz, working in cad design and nuts for soccer, baseball & sailing.  i'm in the mental health sector and have a serious attachment to my camera, shooting pictures as much as possible.   in between work and travel, we also tend our city garden of flowers, vegetables and for the first time this year, grapes.   

we're both easy-going, like to meet new people, non-smokers.  loving the northwest, we can supply you with all manner of information on tourist sites including museums, parks, tours, day trips, kayak rentals, restaurants and pubs.  i'm also a non-drinker, friend of bill w, but adam likes a newcastle brown ale now and again, and of course talking soccer.   
 
we look forward to having you share our little piece of city oasis.    cheers!

the sammamish lake view property is located on the ""east side,"" an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area, and the seattle property is on the ""west side"" in a suburb next to downtown seattle, which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe.  while that was a lot of what may have been useless information to some, it was a long way of telling you that even though we don’t have a lot of reviews on airbnb, we are trustworthy, experienced and work to provide customer satisfaction so that you’ll have the best stay possible.

i have a bsc in mechanical engineering from tel aviv university.
i work in the software engineering industry since 1997. 
i am an urban traveler who loves to explore cities wherever/whenever. my favorite touring style would be city tour by foot or by bike. observe the people, smell the smells enjoy the architecture and landscapes; eat the local food and enjoy the city atmosphere. jogging across the city is also fun thing to do here in seattle as well as in many other cities. 
i am a sport person, love to watch sport live in stadiums as well as on tv. football, basketball, tennis, soccer, ski. 
australia - this is a place i would definitely explore in the coming time! one of the most exciting places, this is how i see it from the distance. 

home cooking- this is another thing that i love to do... healthy home cooking is my strong side and i have been doing it for many years! as long as there are few ingredients available in the kitchen, i can fix a nice dinner!

from hospitality perspective, i focus on 3 things that i usually look for when i search for hotel/apartment... 
1. the cleanest place that i can feel comfort and cozy. 
2. provide all possible amenities,
3. location location location

i pay attention to the details in term of amenities/cleaning and maintenance. i am constantly improving the customer experience of my guests by listening to their comments/feedback i receive... and if it is aligned with my philosophy.. i take the appropriate actions or define an action plan to make the changes over time. 

i will be very happy to hear any feedback in order to improve in the coming future, so feel free to provide your review!

my specialty is last-minute short-stay accommodations, but please be smart about your expectations: if it's less than a month before any kind of holiday, concert, or event, it's likely already booked up. accommodations in indio and palms springs sell out within an hour of coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. 

you can book as far as 13 months out.

*if you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.

if you want to book a friday or a saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)

i have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. have more than eight? you can rent more that one unit! the maximum occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the fire marshal said so. respect the fire marshal's wisdom.

almost all units have a complete kitchen. in addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. all linens, including towels, are included. you have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.

sadly, the resorts do not allow pets.

wifi is $4.95/day or $15.95/stay. this is 100% a resort fee that i have 0% control over.

this is a timeshare. someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. they'll even give you a present if you say yes! saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. be smart - say no - go enjoy your vacation! :)

we've had too many bad experiences with guests from orange county, california. if you are a current or former resident of orange county and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.

***feel good about your vacation! a portion of every rental fee goes to help purchase clothing, shoes, school supplies, medical supplies, and nutritious food for children through children international. learn more about children international and consider sponsoring a child yourself!***",47.6135604076,-122.333046487

mark chambers and oda egeland have owned st. john's since january 2005.  when they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  they went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  mark did most of the work himself.  we now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  it's a great building.  they live in the country, 30 miles from st. john's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. i'm sure you'll love it too!

a little bit about me: mark and oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! i help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. i'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of st. john's into my studio space. i love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so i love airbnb's people-to-people way of seeing the world. my style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but i love when people drop in my office for a chat and i'm always happy to dole out some advice on seattle! i was born and raised in this city so i know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. i wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there! 

i've been pondering this nugget lately: ""trade your cleverness in for awe."" helps to look up at the sky; there's always something awe-inspiring going on up there.",47.6132097848,-122.323277626

i am just a mutable human being, with a constant passion to experience new things and experiment with life just as much as it likes experimenting with me. i travel a lot on the job as well as for pleasure, and try to spend the my free time indulging in new experiences, especially those that involve culture and arts. 

when i am not working, i am dancing. i have been heavily invested in dance studies, and living and dancing have become 2 verbs that are very interconnected to me. i also enjoy the performing arts, experiencing new foods, and sharing stories with beautiful souls that i come across along the way. 

after traveling a lot through surfing couches and hosteling, it is time for me to try airbnb as a new means of cultural exploration. my profile here might not be full yet, so i would happily provide potential hosts and guests with links to my other web profiles verifications and references. i look forward to meeting you!

my hosting style? 
flexible. i want my guests to have the experience they are hoping for. if you want a quiet haven, you'll have it. you can be as independent and have as much alone time as you like. but if you want to have coffee with me in the morning, or watch a movie, or walk down to the beach with me and my dog to get some exercise and see the beautiful puget sound - i like that too.

i used to read and (try to) speak french and german. if you speak either of these feel free to try it out on me, but go slow and be patient!

as a guest?
if i'm travelling for enjoyment, i like getting to meet and interact with my host a little bit. i want the chance to meet new people and discover how they live and what their neighborhoods are like. 
if i'm traveling for business, i will probably want a quiet and organized place to come back to and rejuvenate after a day of hard work.

i haven't decided on just one yet. but here are two i love:

john steinbeck:
""a kind of light spread out from her.
and everything changed color.
and the world opened.

hi i'm chelsi here is a little bit about me: 

quotes that i like: 
""attack life, it kills you anyways""
""true measure of your character is what you're willing to do when others aren't looking"" 

i love to read. i don't make enough time to read though. i'm at the beach, which is right down the street, as often as i can. 
i love to write, draw, paint and doing artistic things. interior design is expensive so i love to bargain shop and reclaim vintage items or steal a deal at a funky thrift store. 

you'll find the interior design at this place is an eclectic piece of living art. each piece has a historical story and most are cannabis, music, sci-fi, or seattle related. i am cannabis friendly! i work in the cannabis industry. (chef jeremy cooper has decorated the b&b in an amazing way. he used history, art, music, and cannabis to create an environment that makes you feel like cannabis was never illegal.) 

5 things i can't live without:

the freedom to be me. (i love to play soccer, just before going pro i injured myself)  
good people (in warm places helps) 
a sustainable future!
hope (for a better tomorrow) 
food & water (if its good that's great. if its great ohhhhhh my dog!)

i love to travel! when i'm not traveling, i want to talk to people with stories of there travels. that's why i love doing the b&b. i love taking care of people and giving them the hospitality we all deserve. 

i travel in style, simple, but comfortable, always looking for that next adventure, that little bit of something that gives my mind an opportunity to open more and more. 

i hope you will join us for an experience in seattle's hospitality driven cannabis b&b.

stay in simple luxury, and enjoy an uplifting, educational, delicious, canna-cation.

my goal is to make your stay at the ""architect's gem"" one of the best you've ever had!

about owners: brandon & shanna

a family of architects (plus two kids), we are live a bi-coastal existence. we started our architecture firm about 13 years ago, and we've enjoyed fantastic growth, designing green homes and live/work urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the seattle area. we are proud to have contributed to the built-space of seattle in a positive, forward-thinking way, and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home — which you can now enjoy.

why west seattle:

we *love* our west seattle home, and because we are architects we've been able to add to the home's charm over the years as we've lived in it. the house itself is a classic 1917 bungalow, but we've added some great usable space and functionality, with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details. we were drawn to west seattle because of the wonderful, varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that west seattle has to offer: admiral district (where we are); alki beach (must-see); alaska junction (the main urban core); morgan junction (great pub and restaurants); fauntleroy/endolyne (ferry to vashon and peninsula, great restaurants); westwood village (convenient 'town centre' mall). we think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house!

the unique benefits at this house:
 
our home is one that you will immediately feel 'at home' with. we've designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces, as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax. fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book, or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room. walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs, bars, and restaurants, enjoy a jaunt down to alki beach for a nice mexican meal at cactus! and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert. during the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk (walking and biking path) in seattle. visit salty's restaurant on harbor avenue overlooking the seattle skyline, or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the elliott bay. or, if you want to tour the pike place market by day or enjoy the seattle nightlife downtown, hop in your car and in 13 minutes (during light traffic) you will be downtown! take a longer ride out to snoqualmie pass for skiing during the winter, or hike, climb, kayak, or sail your way through the summer months in the greater seattle area.

******character references:  

“i have known pina for 18 years since i first moved to seattle, when she owned and operated botticelli caffe. 

as a frequent customer i was able to watch pina run both the café and another restaurant over the years. pina was a tireless worker, sharing her time between the café, her daughter and all of her many friends made through the business. 

 the clientele was made up of regulars who came in for her great smile and great conversation. tourists were always given sound advice and direct ions to all of the best seattle sites.

i was able to work again with pina on the purchase of my home where she was instrumental in finding the house my family enjoyed for several years along with all the close friends and neighbors pina was able to introduce during our residence. pina is always cheerful, dependable and tirelessly working to help those close to her.”  
                
s.b. - interior designer

 ******i was a tenant in an apartment building that pina managed. from inquiring about the apartment, to leasing and maintenance, pina proved herself to be friendly, responsive, and available. 

my husband and i felt comfortable and well supported while the building was under pina's management. when a new manager started, there was an unfortunate and noticeable change in the sense of community within the building. 

after experiencing many other apartment managers, i rate pina as tops. she was always professional, reasonable, and neighborly. i would be lucky to find another manager as caring as pina.
b.s. - transportation consultant

******“i have known pina  for 15 years as a wonderful friend, reliable apartment manager, prosperous business owner, a professional realtor and a wonderfully committed mother.

i'm in senior product management at microsoft, and if i want to make clear that pina rates highly in all areas in my opinion - interpersonal communications skills, her attention to detail, her ability to socialize or work in a group in a charismatic and professional yet relaxed manner. she would be an asset to many and scores highly in my opinion”

i spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office. i am a self-employed property manager who lives/works from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life.  i have a degree in english literature and traveled widely before settling down and ""getting married"" to my house.  i am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean, quiet, self-sufficient and low-maintenance guest.  please note airbnb does not do criminal background checks so when i get a request i will look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a ""safe"" profile.  please make sure your booking request includes the information i request for best results. i started hosting people in july 2014.  as a host i need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting. i don't want a guest who doesn't bother to read my listing, then gives me less than 5 stars for things they should've expected before arriving (such as location - how does a host fix their location? it's on the map!) or value (did you not search other listings first? if you want value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown! they have a better location, no house rules, and don't have to recycle!) if you don't understand the cost of owning real estate  in seattle with its property taxes, sales taxes, cost of utilities and insurance rates, then don't review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first. we're not in kansas anymore, toto!  bottom line: i offer cheap room rentals for short-stay travelers as long as they are well-behaved guests. if you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on airbnb - you're just not going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown.

if you are new to airbnb please look up the internet article:
read these tips, or nobody will ever let you be an airbnb guest again.  

if you are considering becoming a host yourself, i recommend looking up airbnb horror stories and airbnb rental nightmares to understand the risk and liability involved in being one.

i'm from california, so i'm not a typical northwestern person. i like recycling, but composting is the absolute worst. i like saving the world and being green friendly, but i'm also cheap and hate buying more expensive green products. 

i love to travel and experience new things. i'm always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend. (we may have that in common?) i'm also an introvert, which makes me kind of a contradiction since i'm also really loud and possibly obnoxious. 

my life motto: don't be an a-hole. and that is the truth. and be extra nice to people in service jobs, k thanks.

people tell me i'm funny. it's true. i am funny. someone told me i'm captivating the other day. that just makes me roll my eyes though.

i am a fanboy for jurassic park. it's my favorite movie, and i will not tolerate anyone disliking it! you can dislike numbers 2-4 though. i won't fault you that. maybe just don't bring it up. ;)

i'm also a ridiculous fan of game of thrones/a song of ice and fire. maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. maybe not.

my favorite all time place to travel is south lake tahoe. i grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. there is something particularly magnificent about its smell. pine trees are my favorite. you might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. i love trees.

places i've traveled to: caribbean, france, spain, italy, monaco, israel, england, scotland, wales, northern ireland, ireland, sweden, norway, hawaii, grand canyon, chicago, boston, vancouver, bc, portland, or, ukraine, austria, hungary, thailand, lithuania, latvia, estonia, poland, netherlands, belgium, germany, and new zealand. my next trips are iceland and south africa! i'm visiting a past airbnb guest. i can't wait!

places i've lived: sacramento area, ca, salt lake city, ut, and seattle, wa.

i don't have five things i can't live without. i have one. and that is my smart phone. i will die before i give it up. it is always within a foot of me, and i feel lost without it.

my dog:
i have a female dog named lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. she still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that i don't think i will ever train her out of. lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. 

a little more about my background if your curious:
i am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. i transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. i'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. i'd love to have my guests join when that time comes. in the meantime i am dedicated to making sure your airbnb experience is a great one.

we are avid airbnb guests as well as hosts. we first stayed at an airbnb location in sydney, australia, while honeymooning in january 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! not only are the airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond sydney, au, to include a few locations in our home state of washington as well as cities such as vancouver, canada,  portland and bend in oregon, san francisco and sonora, ca, baltimore, miami, and new york city and ithaca, ny, and london, cornwall and bath in the united kingdom. we've been a guest in 21 different airbnb locations over the past 3-1/2 years. in fact, i can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on airbnb. hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

in terms of demographics, we are both in our mid-forties, have traveled all around the country (and the world) and are also are very tidy and respectful. beyond travelling, we like listening to live music, exploring neighborhoods, having fun with our dogs, gardening and cooking great food, spending time near the water/beach, and meeting new people.",47.682309278,-122.378749662

so, with being from the midwest, trekking to the east coast, and now living on the far west coast, i have friends and family all across the country.  i travel to see the people whom i miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the us, and all over the world as well.

how do i travel and see an area?  through food and conversation!  i love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. i ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  i adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things i love in life.  i'm looking forward to using airbnb on many of my future trips.  i've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  but, sometimes i like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine i've snagged along the way.  or, if i'm visiting one of my old homes, i want a place where i can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.

favorite places so far i've visited: ireland - great scotch!  italy - way too many amazing qualities to list. austin - wonderful live music. dc - history, politics, food, hiking, and again too many to list.

i took my first international trip at 9 years old, to mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters, it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people. at 17 i traveled to brisbane australia where i lived for two months. they drank. they were chill. at 21 i headed for capetown south africa, where i blessed to spend 3 months studying, traveling and building relationships. the people i met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today. at 26 i sold my car and bought a ticket to xela, quetzaltenango guatemala where i spent one month with some of the most warmly-spirited people you could ever hope to meet. i attended pop-wuj, a local language school and community restoration group, and the trama textile weaving school/non-profit business, where i was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area. if you ever make it to xela, i would check out the love-work being done in both of these spaces. 

traveling the united states became a passion of mine after i road-tripped to chicago from seattle with one of my best friends. i was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place. i realized that even if i wasn't traveling internationally, i still had opportunities to travel in my home country, and there is just as much to 'know' and see here as anywhere else-and so the era of road trips began!. my family road tripped up and down the west-coast my entire childhood but the midwest and south were uncharted territory for me......

there are some other secret spaces and places, that are for me and my memories to hold, places and destinations so special only a wrong-turn and open heart could have made it so :)

i have made the space i live in a home over the past 6 years and appreciate the evolution. i hope to meet you, hear and become a part of your story soon :) much love, jen",47.6263206079,-122.357366996

more about me:
i'm an all season bike commuter (rain or shine) and i currently bike to work via the burke gilman bike trail. i'm a member of warmshowers (a community of traveling cyclists and hosts) where i share my extra bedroom and bathroom (with a full shower & tub) for free to traveling cyclists. one of my guests from portland wrote: ""lynda has a beautiful place, and i enjoyed staying there. it's in a quiet neighborhood ""north of the cut"" so it's away from the hustle and bustle of the big city, but also right near the burke gilman trail so it's just an easy ride to all that as well. though lynda was on a tight schedule while i was there, she made time for some very pleasant conversation. she also made sure i wanted for nothing. her home is warm and inviting, the accommodations were very nice, and lynda was great.""

i can't live without staying connected to my friends, speaking to people from different countries and backgrounds, a daily workout, trader joe's, and my family,  which includes my hard working husband my son who works in tech in san francisco, and daughter who is in the coast guard.
we are empty nesters, so we decided to make the lower half of our house an airbnb.  it was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world.  we are new to the airbnb community.  we have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out, we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy.  
as an airbnb host, my number one priority is to make you feel completely at home.  i will be available as much as you want or i will stay out of your way.  the downstairs is completely separate.  you will have your privacy.  our house is in the laurelhurst part of seattle.  it is fitted with everything you could possibly need to have a cozy and warm time, including a gas fireplace with a remote, full bath with heated floors.  the wifi works great.
we have so many glorious memories in this house, we will do whatever we can to make your stay in seattle great.
my favorite quote is from helen keller, ""life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all"",  being a host for airbnb has been a daring adventure and it has given energy to our empty nest.",47.6596404841,-122.270777726

i am a professor at the uw, here in seattle.  in the winter i am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  

when i was eleven years old, i saw star wars episode 4, and i haven't been able to concentrate since then. even though i am solidly into middle age, i love living in my super hip seattle neighborhood, and i still go see live music a couple times a month.  

in my twenties and thirties, i would backpack through europe once or twice a year.  one of the greatest things i ever did was decide to rent an apartment in prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  i decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit seattle on a budget. 

i have traveled all over the world, maybe i have visited your town? 

what type of place is this?

are you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  if so, you should probably move on.  this is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  basements have low ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  in the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. i will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   it has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a tv, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... if you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star european hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. 

basically, this is a hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  if you are looking for something affordable in an amazing neighborhood this may work for you.  

you can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...

what type of host am i?

you may never even see me.  once we make arrangements, i will give you the map, the code to the electronic lock, and you can come and go as you please.

my home is in the ""center of the universe"" in the artsy and eclectic fremont area - where you find the troll under aurora bridge, a great pcc coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2016 holiday season
holiday events in and around fremont include the lighting of the lenin statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the fremont arts council winter feast on or close to dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, first friday art walk, new years eve spectacular fire works on lake union, and access to all the seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the nutcracker with the pacific northwest ballet, and seattle symphony's new years eve party!  

summer solstice
the famous fremont solstice parade happens every june close to summer solstice.  in 2014 i was an ice queen clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, sarah lovett. in 2015 i was a banner carrier with the lead samba ensemble group girasol.  

the neighborhood
as to the fremont neighborhood, i moved here years ago thinking i'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, i'm still here.  we have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  i live on a hill and have a partial view of mt rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  and it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

foodie w/o gluten!!
after years, and maybe more years, i'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  my cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
but i taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

more...
for myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the boot lady in seattle, is not an option.  

and this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  with a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40"" vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. if you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  if you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  if you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out ""super cool in artsy fremont""!     

favorite coffee - lighthouse roaster from right up the street at 43rd and phinney.
favorite view - from the sun dial at the top of gas works park hill.
favorite seattle park - discovery park
what i think about eastern wa - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in seattle, there's nearly always sun!

how i feel about puget sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an island or the olympic penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me (website hidden). rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.  

i love traveling in france and europe in general, mexico, the american west and southwest, and now, south america.  my favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.  or with a group of like minded people on a small group tour.  or by car locally and in the southwest where the wide open spaces bring freedom to my soul.",47.6542975861,-122.352588507
