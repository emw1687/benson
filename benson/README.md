WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), a non-profit organization in New York City, is raising money for their inaugural girlâ€™s summer coding bootcamp. In order to provide underprivileged girls with scholarships, they need to raise $50,000 at their annual fundraising gala. From their previous galas, WTWY knows women working in tech and attendees with incomes above $200,000 are most likely to donate. To promote the event, street teams are being placed outside subway stations to hand out free gala tickets. In order to optimize the locations of our street teams, we are using MTA turnstile data and census data to locate subway stops in neighborhoods with average incomes of at least $200,000, high commuter ridership, and stops near major tech companies.
