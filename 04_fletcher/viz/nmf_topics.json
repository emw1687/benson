( i told you i want to do everything)\r\n\r\ni have a lot of day activity and nightlife connections with the transportation company i manage, if you want to do a little exploring- we've got the hook up.  we like to let our guests determine if they want some private personal time while using our space or want the works with sight seeing suggestions and even the option of tagging along with us for some fun. (warning it can get a little crazy with us, especially once the party bus gets rolling, lol ). it is very common to see buses coming or going from our property at various hours of the day and night.  you can book airport / train / bus pick ups and drop off'(email hidden), please enter airbnb as the referral to receive a discount.\r\n\r\nwe are open to any and all guests as along as everyone is respectful and polite.  your race, sexual preference or religion is respected as long as you extend the same respect. our space has its own keyless entry so you're welcome to come and go as you please without worrying about disturbing the rest of the house. \r\n\r\ni hope to have you stay with us...check out our reviews and book a night!\r\n\r\nps: this is not a 5 star hotel, whats in the photos is in the house. \r\n\r\nprez & cherie\r\n",

(pictured here)\r\n\r\nfriends who know me know that i love being a steward to houses, even working by day for a house moving company where we save full-sized craftsman-style homes by physically *moving* them from one place to another (by land or by barge). nickel bros house moves have been featured on home & garden tv's shows \"haulin' house,\" and on discovery and national geographic channels' \"monster moves.\"\r\n\r\nmy goal is to make your stay at the \"architect's gem\" one of the best you've ever had!\r\n\r\n\u2014 jeff\r\n\r\nabout owners: brandon & shanna\r\n\r\na family of architects (plus two kids), we are live a bi-coastal existence. we started our architecture firm about 13 years ago, and we've enjoyed fantastic growth, designing green homes and live/work urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the seattle area. we are proud to have contributed to the built-space of seattle in a positive, forward-thinking way, and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home \u2014 which you can now enjoy.\r\n\r\nwhy west seattle:\r\n\r\nwe *love* our west seattle home, and because we are architects we've been able to add to the home's charm over the years as we've lived in it. the house itself is a classic 1917 bungalow, but we've added some great usable space and functionality, with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details. we were drawn to west seattle because of the wonderful, varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that west seattle has to offer: admiral district (where we are); alki beach (must-see); alaska junction (the main urban core); morgan junction (great pub and restaurants); fauntleroy/endolyne (ferry to vashon and peninsula, great restaurants); westwood village (convenient 'town centre' mall). we think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house!\r\n\r\nthe unique benefits at this house:\r\n \r\nour home is one that you will immediately feel 'at home' with. we've designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces, as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax. fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book, or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room. walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs, bars, and restaurants, enjoy a jaunt down to alki beach for a nice mexican meal at cactus! and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert. during the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk (walking and biking path) in seattle. visit salty's restaurant on harbor avenue overlooking the seattle skyline, or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the elliott bay. or, if you want to tour the pike place market by day or enjoy the seattle nightlife downtown, hop in your car and in 13 minutes (during light traffic) you will be downtown! take a longer ride out to snoqualmie pass for skiing during the winter, or hike, climb, kayak, or sail your way through the summer months in the greater seattle area.\r\n\r\nyear purchased: 1998",

(we may have that in common?) i'm also an introvert, which makes me kind of a contradiction since i'm also really loud and possibly obnoxious. \r\n\r\nmy life motto: don't be an a-hole. and that is the truth. and be extra nice to people in service jobs, k thanks.\r\n\r\npeople tell me i'm funny. it's true. i am funny. someone told me i'm captivating the other day. that just makes me roll my eyes though.\r\n\r\ni am a fanboy for jurassic park. it's my favorite movie, and i will not tolerate anyone disliking it! you can dislike numbers 2-4 though. i won't fault you that. maybe just don't bring it up. ;)\r\n\r\ni'm also a ridiculous fan of game of thrones/a song of ice and fire. maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. maybe not.\r\n\r\nmy favorite all time place to travel is south lake tahoe. i grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. there is something particularly magnificent about its smell. pine trees are my favorite. you might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. i love trees.\r\n\r\nplaces i've traveled to: caribbean, france, spain, italy, monaco, israel, england, scotland, wales, northern ireland, ireland, sweden, norway, hawaii, grand canyon, chicago, boston, vancouver, bc, portland, or, ukraine, austria, hungary, thailand, lithuania, latvia, estonia, poland, netherlands, belgium, germany, and new zealand. my next trips are iceland and south africa! i'm visiting a past airbnb guest. i can't wait!\r\n\r\nplaces i've lived: sacramento area, ca, salt lake city, ut, and seattle, wa.\r\n\r\ni don't have five things i can't live without. i have one. and that is my smart phone. i will die before i give it up. it is always within a foot of me, and i feel lost without it.\r\n\r\nas a host, i hope i'm welcoming and provide a few laughs and fantastic food recommendations. or we might not even meet. it all depends on the day! my full-time job is unpredictable. my house may not be the place for you if you depend on having a host there all the time to make you breakfast, entertain you, or turn your bed down at night. i can either be the busiest person or the biggest couch potato in the world. next week, i'm working 12-14 hours every day. the week after, not so much.\r\n\r\ncool fact: i could say \"hello,\" \"goodbye,\" \"thank you,\" and the number 2 in 5-10 languages. i was that awesome. but now i'm not as awesome and lost this skill. help me learn again?",
